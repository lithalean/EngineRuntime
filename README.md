## ‚ú® Current Status: **FRESH DARWIN ARM64 DEVELOPMENT - GROUND UP DESIGN**

## üéØ Project Vision

Building a **Darwin ARM64-first game development environment** designed exclusively for Apple Silicon with native SwiftUI integration. This is **NOT a port** - it's a fresh, ground-up development runtime optimized specifically for the Darwin ARM64 ecosystem.

**ABANDONING JenovaRuntime**: The original JenovaRuntime's Windows/Linux-first design created too many Darwin ARM64 issues. EngineRuntime is a **complete fresh start** designed for Foundation APIs, SwiftUI integration, and Apple Silicon performance from day one.

The runtime features native Darwin architecture throughout - SwiftUI handling all UI, Foundation APIs for all system integration, and Metal for all graphics acceleration! üçé

### üöÄ **What's Being Built (Ground Up):**
- üèóÔ∏è **Foundation APIs First** - Native Darwin system integration from scratch
- üéØ **SwiftUI Integration Native** - UI framework designed-in from the beginning
- ‚ö° **Metal + Core Audio Exclusive** - Darwin graphics and audio only
- üî• **ARM64 Optimized Runtime** - Apple Silicon-specific code generation
- üß† **FSEvents Native** - Darwin file system monitoring throughout
- üíæ **Clang++ Exclusive** - Darwin ARM64 development toolchain

## üö´ **What We Abandoned**

### **Why JenovaRuntime Had to Go**
```cpp
// JENOVARUNTIME (Windows/Linux-first - ABANDONED):
#ifdef WINDOWS
    use_msvc_compiler();
    use_windows_apis();
#elif LINUX  
    use_gcc_compiler();
    use_linux_apis();
#endif
// + Cross-platform abstractions, portable APIs, compatibility layers

// ENGINERUNTIME (Darwin ARM64-first - FRESH START):
// Foundation APIs ONLY
// SwiftUI integration ONLY
// Metal graphics ONLY  
// Core Audio ONLY
// Clang++ ONLY
// Apple Silicon ONLY
```
